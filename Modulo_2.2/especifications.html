    <h1>Especifications of Telescope James Webb</h1>
    <p>Discussions of a Hubble follow-on started in the 1980s, but serious planning began in the early 1990s.[68] 
        The Hi-Z telescope concept was developed between 1989 and 1994:[69] a fully baffled[a] 4 m (13 ft) aperture infrared 
        telescope that would recede to an orbit at 3 Astronomical unit (AU).[70] This distant orbit would have benefited from reduced light noise from zodiacal dust.
        [70] Other early plans called for a NEXUS precursor telescope mission.[71][72]

        <h1>Telescope Webb</h1>
        
        <p>The <span>James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)</span> is a space telescope designed primarily to conduct infrared astronomy. 
            As the largest optical telescope in space, its greatly improved infrared resolution and sensitivity allows it to view objects too old, distant, 
            or faint for the Hubble Space Telescope. This is expected to enable a broad range of investigations across the fields of astronomy and cosmology, 
            such as observation of the first stars and the formation of the first galaxies, and detailed atmospheric characterization of potentially habitable exoplanets.

        <h2>Scientific instruments</h2>
        <p>The Integrated Science Instrument Module (ISIM) is a framework that provides electrical power, 
            computing resources, cooling capability as well as structural stability to the Webb telescope. 
            It is made with bonded graphite-epoxy composite attached to the underside of Webb's telescope structure. 
            The ISIM holds the four science instruments and a guide camera.
